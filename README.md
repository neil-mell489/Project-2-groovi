This is a web application built to help people begin, develop and track healthy habits. Think of it like a weekly planner but made specifically for healthy habits you want to experiment with. Submit Habits and they will appear on your homepage, giving you a convenient overview of your current habits. Groovi is meant to encourage users to be consistent and committed in the pursuit of their healthy habits. All of that considered, remember that progress is not linear. 

Thank you for viewing my app! Hope you like getting groovi!
